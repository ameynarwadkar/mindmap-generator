# Body mass index (BMI)

## Summary

* BMI is an approximate measure of total body fat.
* Waist circumference often predicts health risk better.
* Both underweight and overweight (especially when inactive) can cause health problems. ([betterhealth.vic.gov.au][1])

---

## About body fat

* Normal to store fat, but too much or too little increases health risks.
* Fat distribution matters more than total fat—abdominal fat (measured by waist circumference) is linked to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. ([betterhealth.vic.gov.au][1])
* While DXA scans are most accurate, BMI is a cheaper approximation method. ([betterhealth.vic.gov.au][1])

## What is BMI?

* **Formula:**
  BMI = weight (kg) ÷ \[height (m)]² ([en.wikipedia.org][2])
* Applicable to adults only. In adults, BMI usually reflects body fat. ([betterhealth.vic.gov.au][1])
* Adult BMI categories (WHO-defined):

  * **<18.5** kg/m² – underweight
  * **18.5–24.9** – healthy weight
  * **25–29.9** – overweight
  * **≥30** – obese ([en.wikipedia.org][2], [betterhealth.vic.gov.au][1])
* For older adults (≥70 years), a BMI range of **22–26** kg/m² may be more appropriate. ([betterhealth.vic.gov.au][1])

## Limitations of BMI

BMI cannot differentiate fat from muscle or account for distribution:

* **May overestimate fat** in:

  * Bodybuilders and elite athletes
  * Pregnant individuals&#x20;
* **May underestimate fat** in:

  * Elderly (muscle loss)
  * People with certain disabilities ([betterhealth.vic.gov.au][1], [en.wikipedia.org][2])
* Less accurate in: very short (<150 cm) or tall (>190 cm) individuals and in different ethnic groups (e.g., Asians have higher fat at lower BMI). For Asian populations, health risks can begin at **BMI ≈ 23 kg/m²**. ([betterhealth.vic.gov.au][1])

## BMI for children and teens

* Use age- and sex-specific percentile charts (based on CDC growth charts) for those aged 2–20 years. ([betterhealth.vic.gov.au][3])
* Charts guide lifestyle decisions and when to seek professional advice. ([betterhealth.vic.gov.au][4])

## Health risks linked to abnormal BMI

* **Increased BMI → higher risk** for illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, cancers (colon, breast), gallbladder disease, and depression. Risk of death increases \~20–30% with BMI rising from 25 to 27, then \~60% above. ([betterhealth.vic.gov.au][1])
* **Being underweight (<18.5)** may indicate malnutrition, eating disorders, or other health concerns. ([en.wikipedia.org][2])

---

## Waist circumference

* A better measure of health risk than BMI.
* Combine waist measurement with BMI for adults.
* **High-risk thresholds:**

  * Men: >94 cm → overweight risk; >102 cm → obesity risk
  * Women: >80 cm → overweight risk; >88 cm → obesity risk ([betterhealth.vic.gov.au][1], [betterhealth.vic.gov.au][5], [betterhealth.vic.gov.au][4])

## Where to get help

* Consult your **doctor**, **dietitian**, or allied health professionals for personalised advice. ([betterhealth.vic.gov.au][1])

For further tools and guidance:

* Adult BMI calculator: healthy range \~20–25 (22–26 for older adults) ([betterhealth.vic.gov.au][5])
* BMI calculator for children/teens: takes 2–20 years into account ([betterhealth.vic.gov.au][3])
